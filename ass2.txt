Blockchain Day-1 Assignment

DAY 1 Assignment:

1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?

Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it
difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated
and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the
blockchain.
A Blockchain is a mix of technology- Distributed Database & Crypography.
In this there are many blocks that store the content and previous hash value.


Q2. What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?

The core problems that Blockchain solves:
1. Security
2. Decentralization.
3. Authentication.

Q3. What are the few features which Blockchain will give u?

1. Verifiable
2. Unchangeable
3. Tamper proof
4. Immutable
5. Decentralized System
6. Mining


Q4. What all things does a Block Contain?

A Block Contains:

1. Block number.
2. Transaction Records.
3. Previous block signature.
5. Mining Key.

Q5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained?

Verification in blockchain is a consensus mechanism based process.
Since blockchain acts as a decentralized ledger with multiple nodes in the
network, the transaction must be verified by all nodes. ...
The transactions in a blockchain are referred to by their hash.

The Blockchain can be verifiability by the data and the key that are stored in
the distributed systems.

Block 1 = A+B = C
Block 2 = B+D = F
Where,
A is Genesis Block,which doesn't have a previous blocks signature.
B & D are data to be stored.
C & F are Signatures.
